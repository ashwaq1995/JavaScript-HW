    - Store the length of rectangle. 
    - Store the width of rectangle.
    - Calculate the area and print the output "The area of the rectangle is: NN" 
    
- The Temperature Converter  
    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.

## For loop
### Numbers' summations
* Loop though this array `let Numbers = [23,54,32,87,47]` and print the sum of all numbers

### Maximum number
- Create an array of the following numbers [16,4,2,0,19,6]
- Loop through the array elements and print the maximum number of this list to the console.

### Reverse Array 
- Create an array of the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
- print the array in a reverse order


## Nested for loop


### stars pattern
